                <p>The saying "You will never know until you do it" certainly holds true for me. I've been a dj, cook, warehouse aide,
                    Imaging specialist, event space manager, non-profit volunteer, scuba diver, endurance cyclist among other things. 
                    I'm naturally curious and am very thankful for the internet.</p>

                <p>I am currently fully committed to becoming a full stack web developer. If you have suggestions or feedback, feel free 
                    to get in touch with me through the contact link. Thanks for visiting this page.</p>
